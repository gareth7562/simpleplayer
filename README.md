Requires node to run

to run install dependencies with

**npm install**

**npm start**

requires mpv binaries and youtube-dlp binaries

when using youtube-dlp rename to youtube-dl.exe
and place in the mpv directory

the mpv directory should be in the root of the install folder i.e. SimplePlayer/mpv/

you can also change the mpv directory from the settings page by browsing for the mpv executable file.

you can download the latest binaries from the releases page with included mpv and youtube-dlp. Only windows binaries atm

if you need to build an executable you can use https://github.com/nodegui/packer
